# Low-Latency Trading Infrastructure Simulator

A systems-level simulator focused on market data ingestion, low-latency execution paths, deterministic timestamping, fan-out, backpressure, failure modeling, and observability without disturbing latency. Includes DevOps realism with runbooks, automation, and failure isolation.

**Note:** Logic will be built incrementally. This repository currently contains only the infrastructure skeleton.
